# Scripts for tests of sticcs and twisst2 sticcstack

This reposository accompanies the paper "A model-free method for genealogical inference without phasing and its application for topology weighting"

The tools described can be found in their own respositorsis:
[`sticcs`](https://github.com/simonhmartin/sticcs) (for ARG inference)
[`twisst2`](https://github.com/simonhmartin/twisst2) (For topology weighting including the `sticcstack` approach described in the paper)

### sim
Scripts for analyses of simulated data, including comparisons with `Relate`, `tsinfer`, `Argweaver` and `Singer`

### Heliconius
